      A CRUD application built with the MERN stack combines the power of
      MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js to enable the creation, retrieval,
      updating, and deletion of data. MongoDB, a flexible NoSQL database, serves
      as the storage solution for the application, allowing data to be stored
      and retrieved in a JSON-like format. Express.js, a backend framework for
      Node.js, handles the routing and middleware functionality, providing a
      robust API for communication between the frontend and backend. React, a
      frontend library, allows the creation of interactive user interfaces,
      managing the application's state and rendering components. Node.js, a
      JavaScript runtime, provides the backend environment for running the
      server-side code.

      The application's functionality revolves around the four primary
      operations: create, read, update, and delete. To create new data, the user
      interacts with the frontend UI, entering information through input fields.
      The frontend sends an HTTP POST request to the server, which is then
      handled by an Express.js route. The server extracts the data from the
      request and saves it to the MongoDB database, creating a new record. This
      process enables users to store new information in the application.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Reading data involves retrieving information from the database and
      displaying it to the user. The frontend sends an HTTP GET request to the
      server, specifying the data it wants to retrieve. The server processes the
      request, queries the MongoDB database, and retrieves the requested data.
      It then sends the data back to the frontend as a response. The frontend
      receives the response and renders the data, presenting it to the user in a
      meaningful way.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Updating data in the application allows users to modify existing
      information. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for making
      changes, such as updating a user's profile or editing a post. When the
      user initiates an update, the frontend sends an HTTP PUT or PATCH request
      to the server, including the updated data. The server receives the
      request, identifies the relevant record in the MongoDB database, and
      applies the modifications. This process ensures that the data in the
      application remains accurate and up to date.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Deleting data removes unwanted information from the application. The
      frontend UI provides options for users to delete specific records, such as
      deleting a comment or removing a product from a shopping cart. When the
      user triggers a delete action, the frontend sends an HTTP DELETE request
      to the server, specifying the record to be deleted. The server handles the
      request, locates the corresponding data in the MongoDB database, and
      removes it. This operation allows users to clean up the application's data
      by removing unnecessary or obsolete information.
